    YAML and Hash implementation(ShoppApp.rb)  
 
          In this approach it is very easy to perform given operation because of hash data structure but while loading the YAML radable format back into the program
          memory is almost not possible. As well performance of the YAML is too slow. 
          read/write overhead is too much for hash to file and file to hash.   
    

    Well, This application can be effectively implemented with the help of array and CSV file.(ShopAppByCSV.rb).
